Pay your regular customers back through food on the house!

------------------------------------------------------------
Idea is to get your food establishment in the front of the queue and leave your competitors behind. The rule of thumb in consumer business is customer satisfaction matters! 

The question is who is your customer and who is not? Wouldn't it be cool if you could know how frequent a customer pays you a visit at your shop! Wouldn't it be cooler we can automate the whole thing, so you just get this information right from the sky!

****************************************************************

Using face recognition, we are identifying people coming in and keeping track of their visits. Fetching data from facebook api to see who all are around you! Set a number, whenever a customer hits that, he/she will be awarded with free food on the house for their loyalty! Word will spread, people will feel good!

Of course, your food should taste good too! Haha!
